## Greetings.
I am definitely Rus. I develop desktop apps, tools, games, and Discord bots, and I design them as if I'll be maintaining them forever. Whether or not I do, that's an entirely separate discussion.

Other computer-related things I do include but not limited to: home servers, Arduino projects, video production, music production, speccing out PC setups I cannot afford, and of course, playing video games.

If you have any questions or requests that you believe I can deliver on, please hesitate to send me a message.
